## Introduction
**Stable Diffusion** is a text-to-image generative AI model. Similar to online services like `DALLÂ·E`, `Midjourney`, and `Bing`, users can input text prompts, and the model will generate images based on said prompts. The main advantage is that `Stable Diffusion` is **open source**, completely **free** to use, and can even run **locally**.

Furthermore, there are many community-developed tools and extensions that can perform a wide range of functions; as well as many community-trained models that can achieve numerous styles and concepts, giving users the full control over generation process.

## Getting Started
> This section will cover some basic information on how to start generating images locally

### Hardware Requirement
To run AI models locally, a Graphics Card (**GPU**) from **Nvidia** is required

> [!NOTE]
> While it is possible to run `Stable Diffusion` on **AMD**, **Apple**, or even **Intel** GPUs, the setup is more complicated and the processing speed is comparably slower

When choosing a GPU, **VRAM** is the most important spec. Sufficient VRAM is essential to fit the entire model into memory; processing speed is only relevant once the model can be fully loaded. If your GPU does not have enough VRAM, the model will be partially loaded into system swap memory instead, significantly reducing the processing speed by up to ten times. Additionally, aim for the RTX 30 series or later, as older GPUs have limited support for half precision. These are the reasons why, RTX 3060 *(`12 GB` VRAM)* is generally recommended over RTX 3070 *(`8 GB` VRAM)* and RTX 2080 *(`11 GB` VRAM)*.

#### Recommendation
- **Entry Level:** RTX 3060 *(`12 GB` VRAM)*
    - **Note:** The **Ti** variant instead only has `8 GB` VRAM
- **Enthusiast:** Second-Hand RTX 3090 *(`24 GB` VRAM)*
- **Professional:** RTX 4090 *(`24 GB` VRAM)*

> **What I am using:** RTX 4070 Ti Super *(`16 GB` VRAM)*

> [!TIP]
> If you do not have a capable system, there are also (paid) [online services](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Online-Services) that host UIs for Stable Diffusion

### Popular UIs
Listed below are some popular **U**ser **I**nterfaces to run Stable Diffusion:

- [Automatic1111 Webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui): A classic frontend that helped popularizing Stable Diffusion in the early days, with a large community and extension supports; though development seems to be halted as of now

- [Forge Webui](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge): A frontend based on **Automatic1111**, with a more optimized memory management that allows even low-end devices to run Stable Diffusion; though some find Gradio 4 unresponsive

> [!TIP]
> [Installation Guide](./Installation.md) for **Automatic1111** / **Forge**

- [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI): An advanced node-based frontend, providing the maximum flexibility for users to build custom complex workflows; though the learning curve is steeper as a result

- [Fooocus](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus): A rather simple frontend, suitable for those who simply want beautiful artworks by just writing a prompt

- [SwarmUI](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/SwarmUI), [InvokeAI](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI), [SD.Next](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic): Other notable frontends; though personally I've never tried them

- [Stability Matrix](https://github.com/LykosAI/StabilityMatrix): A platform that simplifies frontends and models management

> **What I am using:** [Forge Classic](https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-webui-forge-classic), based on the "previous" (Gradio 3) version of **Forge**, with a few minor updates added

## Models
> When talking about Stable Diffusion, the word "model" can refer to various things

### Architecture
There has been numerous architectures released over the years. Listed below are the most widely adopted versions as of now:

- **`Stable Diffusion 1.5`:** The good ol' version that basically brought local image generation into the mainstream. As the smallest model with a base resolution of only `512x512` and an inability to generate hands reliably, its quality is less comparable nowadays. But it remains quite popular thanks to its lower system requirements.
    - *(hereinafter referred to as **SD1** below)*
- **`Stable Diffusion XL`:** The newer and bigger version with a base resolution of `1024x1024`. It now understands prompts better and has a lower chance of generating *eldritch abominations*. But it also has considerably higher system requirements.
    - *(hereinafter referred to as **SDXL** below)*
- **`Pony Diffusion V6 XL`**: A version of SDXL that underwent extensive training, causing many features to be incompatible between the two, resulting in a distinct category. This model was specially fine-tuned on "Booru tags" to generate anime/cartoon images, with good prompt comprehension and the ability to generate correct hands/feet.
    - *(hereinafter referred to as **Pony** below)*

> [!TIP]
> **Booru Tags** refers to the comma-separated tags used by Booru image sites; see this post of [Hatsune Miku](https://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=post&s=view&id=209067) for example *(other posts on the site might be **NSFW** ! )*

- **`Flux`**: One of the hottest new architecture, capable of generating legible text and next-gen quality, with next-gen hardware requirements...
    - ~~Don't bother if you have less than 12 GB VRAM~~
    - ~~Technically this is not Stable Diffusion~~
    - Automatic1111 Webui does not support Flux yet...
    - This model has 3 variants:
        - **`pro`:** *Only available through **paid** online services*
        - **`dev`:** Distilled from `pro`, uses standard number of steps **(non-commercial)**
        - **`schnell`:** Further distilled from `dev`, requires fewer number of steps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Models of different architectures are **not** compatible with each other *(**eg.** a LoRA trained on SD1 will **not** work with SDXL checkpoints, etc.)*

### Checkpoint
**Checkpoint** is what "model" usually refers to. It is the whole package that contains **UNet**, **Text Encoder**, and **VAE**.
- For SD1 and SDXL, models are usually distributed in a single checkpoint format
- For Flux, the components are usually distributed separately due to the size and other limitations

> [!NOTE]
> Put **Checkpoint** in `~webui\models\Stable-diffusion`

### UNet
**U-Net** is the core component that processes the latent noises to generate the image.

> [!NOTE]
> Put **UNet** in `~webui\models\Stable-diffusion`

### Text Encoder
**Text Encoder** is the component that converts the human-readable prompts into vectors that the model understands.
- SD1, SDXL, and Flux all use the small **Clip** text encoders *(only hundreds of `MB` in size)*
- Flux additionally uses the big **T5** text encoder *(**T5** at `fp16` precision is almost `10 GB`)*

> [!NOTE]
> Put **Text Encoder** in `~webui\models\text_encoder`

### VAE
**VAE** is the component that converts RGB images to/from latent space

> [!NOTE]
> Put **VAE** in `~webui\models\VAE`

### Embedding
**Embedding** *(or **Textual Inversion**)* is a technique used to train the Text Encoder to learn specific concepts *(**eg.** Characters, Style, etc.)*

> [!NOTE]
> Put **Embedding** in `~webui\embeddings`

### LoRA
**LoRA** *(and **LyCORIS**)* is a technique used to train the UNet *(and sometimes Text Encoder)* to learn specific concepts *(**eg.** Characters, Style, etc.)*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most LoRAs require **trigger words** to function correctly. Be sure to read the description / info.

> [!NOTE]
> Put **LoRA** in `~webui\models\Lora`

### How to Use
- To change **Checkpoint**, select from the `Stable Diffusion checkpoint` dropdown at the top of the UI
    - To use the separated components for **Flux** in Forge, refer to this [Announcement](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge/discussions/1050)
- To use **Embedding**, click on the model card to add the filename to the prompt field
- To use **LoRA**, click on the model card to add the syntax to the prompt field
- To manually set a **VAE**, select from the `SD VAE` dropdown in the `VAE` section of the `Settings` tab

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see your newly added models, remember to click the **Refresh** button first

### Download
**[CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models)** is a site that hosts all sorts of models and user-generated resources such as guides. When browsing, you can click the `Filters` to look for a specific model type or architecture. Every page contains user comments, ratings, and samples. Remember to check the `Base Model` in the `Details` before downloading.

> [!NOTE]
> `.safetensors` is a format to store the weights safely; always choose `.safetensors` if available

### Diffusers
On [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/), you may come across repositories where each component is separated into sub-folders, such as [epiCRealism](https://huggingface.co/emilianJR/epiCRealism/tree/main). This format is used by the [Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/index) library. However, the Webui does not support this format. Usually you can find a link to the checkpoint format used by the Webui instead in the `Model card`.

## Terminologies
> This section will cover some `noun.` used within the Webui

### Tabs
- **`txt2img`:** Generate image based on input prompts
- **`img2img`:** Generate image based on an input image and prompts
- **`Extras`:** Process images *(**incl.** Upscale, Caption, Crop, etc.)*
  - You can download better upscale models from [OpenModelDB](https://openmodeldb.info/)

> [!NOTE]
> Put **upscaler** in `~webui\models\ESRGAN`

- **`PNG Info`:** You can upload a generated image to see the infotext *(provided that the metadata was not stripped)*
- **`Checkpoint Merger`:** ~~The easiest way to spam "something" onto CivitAI~~
- **`Train`:** Broken; use **[Kohya_SS](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss)** instead
- **`Settings`:** Settings ð
- **`Extensions`:** Install & Manage [Extensions](#extensions)

### Parameters
- **`Prompt`:** The text for what you want in the output
- **`Negative Prompt`:** The text for what you donât want in the output
- **`Sampling Method`:** Read this [article](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/samplers/) for explanations and examples
    - **TL;DR:** `Euler a` tends to generate smoother images, suitable for anime checkpoints; `DPM++ 2M Karras` tends to generate detailed images, suitable for realistic checkpoints

> [!NOTE]
> Since Webui `v1.9.0`, the Sampler and Scheduler are now two separated dropdowns

- **`Sampling Steps`:** The number of denoising iterations
  - `20` ~ `32` is generally enough
  - Low value causes the output to be blurry; High value takes longer
  - **[LCM](https://huggingface.co/latent-consistency/lcm-lora-sdxl)** and **[Lightning](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning)** models can generate decent images with as few as 4 steps
  - **[Turbo](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo)** models can even generate decent images with just 1 step
- **`Hires. Fix`:** Upscale then run through the pipeline a second time to improve output
- **`Refiner`:** Obsolete; just ignore it...
- **`Width/Height`:** The resolution of the generated image

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep it at `512x512` for **SD1** models; around `1024x1024` for **SDXL** models; and keep both `width` and `height` at multiples of `64` *(**eg.** `1152x896`)*

- **`Batch Count`:** How many batches to generate *(in series)*
- **`Batch Size`:** How many images per batch *(in parallel)*
- **`CFG Scale`:** How strong the prompts influence the output
  - `4` ~ `8` is generally fine
  - Low value generates blurry images; High value generates "burnt" *(really distorted)* images
  - For **LCM**, **Lightning**, **Turbo**, or other low-steps models, set it to **`1`** instead
- **`Seed`:** The random seed that affects the latent noise generation
  - You *should* get the same output if you use the same settings

> [!TIP]
> Go to the `Stable Diffusion` section of the `Settings` tab, and change **`Random number generator source`** to **`CPU`** for the maximum recreatibility across different systems

## Settings
> Listed below are some settings recommended to change or frequently asked about

#### Saving images/grids
> These settings modify the saving behavior

- **File format for images:**
    - `png` is lossless with the largest filesize
    - `jpg` is lossy with the smallest filesize
    - `webp` is in-between, but takes longer to save
- **Save copy of large images as JPG:**
    - If `enabled`, when you generate a high-resolution image, it would additionally save a `.jpg` once the filesize threshold is reached

#### Optimizations
> These settings can improve the generation speed

- **Cross attention optimization:**
    - `xformers` if enabled; `sdp - scaled dot product` otherwise
    - `Automatic` for Forge Webui
- **Pad prompt/negative prompt** - `Enable`
- **Persistent cond cache** - `Enable`
- **Batch cond/uncond** - `Enable`

#### Stable Diffusion
> These settings affect the generation details

- **Enable quantization in K samplers:**
    - I myself did `enable` this, though the effect seem minimal
- **Emphasis mode:**
    - Setting it to `No norm` prevents a problem where certain models tend to generate pure noises
- **Clip skip:**
    - ~~Long story short,~~ some models work better with `2`; but setting it to `2` doesn't worsen other models anyway. So just set it to `2`...

#### Live previews
> These settings affect the preview during generation

- **Live preview method** - `TAESD`
- **Return image with chosen live preview method on interrupt** - `Enable`

#### System
> These settings modify the behavior of the Webui

- **Automatically open webui in browser on startup:**
    - Change this if you don't want the browser to start automatically
- **Show gradio deprecation warnings in console** - `Disable`

## Extensions
> Extensions are basically 3rd-party add-ons that provide additional features not native to the Webui

### Installation
1. Go to the **Extensions** tab
2. Switch to the **Install from URL** sub-tab
3. In the `URL for extension's git repository` field, paste in the link to an Extension
    - **eg.** https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-webui-tabs-extension
4. **(Optional)** In certain use cases, you may need to fill out the `Specific branch name` field, usually for development or compatibility reasons
5. **(Optional)** You can fill out `Local directory name` to set a folder name *(The practical use of this is to sort Extensions)*
6. Click the **Install** button
7. Some Extensions may install additional dependencies; this may take some time
8. Once the installation is finished, an `Installed into ...` line will appear under the **Install** button
9. Switch to the **Installed** sub-tab
10. Click the **Apply and restart UI** button

> [!TIP]
> Sometimes, after clicking the `Apply and restart UI` button, the browser will refresh first before the Webui is actually ready, and you may see a bunch of disconnected errors on screen. When this happens, do not use the Webui yet. Wait for the console to show the `Running on local URL: ...` line, then manually refresh (`F5`) the browser again. After which, the Webui is good to go.
