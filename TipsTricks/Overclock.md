You can download [MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards) to overclock your GPU and in turn speed up generation.

> Despite the name, it works on GPUs from other brands as well.

- Adjust the sliders to push for higher performance
  - Normally, you should be able to push ~100 for Core Clock and ~500 for Memory Clock
  - **Do some research** and look for others' recommended settings first
- Clicking the Cog icon allows you to adjust other settings as well as changing the skin
- Clicking the Windows icon to automatically apply the overclocking on the next boot
  - **IMPORTANT:** If you enable this while having a faulty setting, your computer may become **unusable** as it tries to apply the settings then automatically shut down right away!
  - Always do testings and benchmarks first before turning this on!
- The actual improvements you can get depend on the silicon lottery
